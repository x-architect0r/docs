## Overview

Buildr is an AI-powered DeFi agent that enables natural language interactions with blockchain protocols. It translates human instructions into secure, optimized on-chain transactions - making Web3 accessible to everyone.

<Note>
Think of Buildr as your smart blockchain assistant that understands commands like "Launch a token called MOON" and handles all the complex technical steps automatically.

    1. User sends natural language command
    2. AI processes intent and generates execution plan
    3. Engine validates and executes transactions
    4. Smart contracts interact with blockchain
    5. Results flow back to user
