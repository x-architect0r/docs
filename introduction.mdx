## Built for Action, Powered by AI

Under the hood, Buildr uses powerful large language models trained to understand Web3-native intent and convert it into live, on-chain execution. Say "launch FLOKIMOON with 1B supply," and your token is live seconds later — contract deployed, LP initialized, and link ready to share.

This isn't just AI — this is automation for the culture.

## Why Buildr Exists

Most DeFi tools are built for devs or power users. Buildr flips that. Our mission is to empower everyone — from first-time memecoin creators to experienced degens — to access blockchain superpowers by simply messaging an AI.
