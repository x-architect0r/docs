## Overview

Buildr can execute actions automatically based on various triggers. From scheduled buys to complex on-chain event responses, automate your strategy without constant monitoring.

<Note>
Automations run on Buildr's secure infrastructure and execute through your wallet only when conditions are met.
</Note>

## Time-Based Triggers

### Scheduled Actions
<CodeGroup>
```bash Basic Scheduling
"Buy 0.1 BNB of PEPE every day at 14:00 UTC"
"Sell 10% of my portfolio every Sunday"
"Check holder count daily at midnight"
```

```bash Advanced Timing
"Execute strategy:
- Buy 0.05 BNB of FLOKI Mon/Wed/Fri at 15:00
- Sell if profit > 20%
- Stop if loss > 5%"
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
Ensure sufficient funds in your wallet for scheduled transactions, including gas fees.
</Warning>

## Price Triggers

### Market Conditions
<CodeGroup>
```bash Price Alerts
"Alert when BNB drops below $200"
"Notify if PEPE pumps 20% in 1 hour"
"Watch 0x123...abc for price movement >5%"
```

```bash Auto-Trading
"When FLOKI hits $0.0001:
- Buy 1 BNB worth
- Set stop loss at -5%
- Take profit at +15%"
```
</CodeGroup>

## On-Chain Triggers

### Contract Events
<CodeGroup>
```bash Liquidity Events
"Alert when new LP added to 0x123...abc"
"Buy if liquidity increases >$100K"

```

```bash Complex Logic

- Sell after 2x or 1 hour"
```
</CodeGroup>

## Volume & Trading Triggers

- Holder growth >10%"
```
</CodeGroup>

## Managing Automations
