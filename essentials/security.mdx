  Your security is our top priority. Buildr implements multiple layers of protection to ensure your assets and data remain safe.

## Wallet Security

### Military-Grade Encryption

Buildr employs military-grade AES-256 encryption for all wallet keys and sensitive data. This is the same level of encryption used by financial institutions and government agencies worldwide.

### Privy Integration

We've partnered with [Privy](https://privy.io) for secure user authentication and data management. This ensures:

- Secure storage of user credentials
- Industry-standard encryption of personal information
- Compliance with data protection regulations
- Zero knowledge architecture

### Key Management

- Private keys are never stored in plain text
- Multi-layer encryption for key storage
- Automated key rotation policies
- Hardware security module (HSM) protection

## Platform Security

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

We strongly recommend enabling 2FA on all platforms connected to your Buildr account:
