## Welcome to the Buildr Agent API

The Buildr Agent API lets you interact programmatically with your on-chain AI companion. You can launch tokens, initiate swaps, track market actions, and automate BNB Chain operations â€” all through simple, AI-powered API calls.

Whether you're integrating Buildr into a dashboard, scripting DeFi automations, or building custom workflows, this API gives you full control with minimal complexity.
