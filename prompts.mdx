## Overview

Buildr understands natural language commands, making complex blockchain operations as simple as sending a message. Here's how to make the most of your AI agent.

<Note>
For best results, be specific with your commands. Include token addresses when possible and clearly state amounts and parameters.
</Note>

## Market Analysis

### Get Token Price & Charts
<CodeGroup>
```bash Basic
"Price of BNB"
"What's PEPE worth?"
